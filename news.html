            network fee based on their respective blockchains, but transfers
            between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users'
            privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
            transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge
            fees for incoming transfers, The company is also working to
            integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central
            bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also
            exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed
            "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence
            of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone
            app.

            operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member
            bloc. The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they
            exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring
            crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for
            investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023,
            instead of the cost at the time of purchase. According to the new
            rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits
            and be carried forward. Investors, however, may require some
            additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the
            document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same
            characteristics and functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."

            Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to
            132,500 BTC

            Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following
            its most recent purchases. This year, the world’s largest
            cryptocurrency has emerged as ‘the institutional-grade digital
            asset,’ said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.
          </p>
          <h3>MicroStrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h3>
          <p>
            Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has
            purchased more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor,
            the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:
          </p>
          <p>
            Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As
            of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03
            billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired
            between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary
            Macrostrategy. The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an
            average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It
            then sold about 704 BTC at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22.
            Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more BTC at $16,845 per coin on
            Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.
            The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy
            sold its bitcoin since it began accumulating the crypto for its
            corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for
            selling BTC. ‘Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses
            resulting from this transaction against previous capital gains, to
            the extent such carrybacks are available under the federal income
            tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,’ the
            SEC filing describes. Saylor said in an interview last week: The
            most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the
            institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is
            one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that
            commodity. The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and
            the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have
            confirmed that bitcoin is a commodity. Saylor previously explained
            that Microstrategy is investing in BTC ‘for the long term.’ He
            added: ‘Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so
            there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the
            millions. So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of
            money.’

            businesses, and miners in general. The prolonged bear market,
            exacerbated by a series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to
            miners. Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including
            defaulted loans, quarterly losses, and soaring bitcoin hashrates
            that reached all-time highs. All these factors were affecting the
            profitability of the miners and were causing sell pressure. The
            situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including
            Bitcoin’s, plummeted. Bitcoin, which was hovering around $48,000
            last year, hit a low of $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the
            data collected from The Block, bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55
